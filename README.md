UPDATE
======
Whew! That was difficult. I had an eventful weekend so I was only able to start the contest about 2 hours and 30 minutes before it ended. I managed to get through Magic Trick on time, but Cookie Clicker Alpha took me some time to figure out. After I had finished it, I managed to get in the small answer solution, but my solution couldn't compile in time for the long answer, and I was too tired to optimize it. And way too tired to start Minesweeper. Ah, well, always next year. At least I had fun and learned a bunch about Python list comprehensions (which are totally freakin awesome, by the way).
